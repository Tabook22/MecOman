﻿var myApp; //this is important because if we put it inside the (function(){ var myApp=......})(); the other object or files which use myApp will not see it, that is 
// why we declare it outside
// the id of (function(){})(); is the prevent any variable declaration from beign seen outside on the globale scale, that is good because it will prevent any varialbe conflict
// because in javascript if we declare any varialbe it will be seen globly, and name conflict can occure, this can be considered a negative thing in javascript
